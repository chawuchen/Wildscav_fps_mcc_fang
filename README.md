# Wildscav_fps_mcc_fang
This is the 1st place solution for 3D Open World FPS Game AI Chanllenge(2022 cog&amp;inspir.AI)

Admittedly, our code currently is far from perfection. It still have large potentials to be completed and developed.

- `agent_for_track1a.py`  and `agent_for_track1b_and_2.py` provide rule-based solution for the track1-1, track1-2 and track2 respectively.

- `agent_RLsimple.py` gives Reinforcement Learning solution, which can be trained by `train_ppo.py`.

Environment used in this task and the evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/inspirai/wilderness-scavenger
